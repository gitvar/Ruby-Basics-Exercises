# Cute angles
#
# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (˚) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.

# Further Exploration

# While our solution works with the expanded range of non-negative numbers, it fails with negative numbers. For instance, dms(-76.73) returns -77°16'12", which is incorrect. Modify our solution so it works with negative values as well as non-negative values.

SECONDS_PER_DEGREE = MINUTES_PER_DEGREE * SECONDS_PER_MINUTE

  while degrees_float < 0
    degrees_float += 360
  end
  while degrees_float > 360
    degrees_float -= 360
  end
  total_seconds = (degrees_float * SECONDS_PER_DEGREE).round
  degrees, remaining_seconds = total_seconds.divmod(SECONDS_PER_DEGREE)
  minutes, seconds = remaining_seconds.divmod(SECONDS_PER_MINUTE)
  format(%(#{degrees}#{DEGREE}%02d'%02d"), minutes, seconds)
